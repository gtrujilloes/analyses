# Monetisation Scenario Analysis

## üìä Objective

The goal of this analysis is to understand how customer **spend behavior** correlates with **financial revenue generation**, particularly through different transaction types (e.g., cards vs invoices), regions, and customer segments.

Key questions addressed include:

- Does high customer spend always translate to high monetisation?
- Which segments and regions generate more revenue per euro spent?
- What would be the revenue impact of improving monetisation rates?

## üìå Key Insights

- The **monetisation rate** (financial revenue √∑ total spend) varies significantly across features and regions.
- **Invoice-based transactions** tend to yield a much lower monetisation rate than card-based ones.
- Certain customer segments (e.g., high spenders with low monetisation) represent clear **opportunities for optimisation**.
- A scenario analysis shows that **standardizing monetisation rates** to a modest target could generate substantial additional revenue.
