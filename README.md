# Analyses

This folder contains all exploratory and statistical analyses related to the project. Each subfolder or notebook focuses on a specific aspect, dataset, or research question.

### Structure
- **weekly_seasonal_indexes**: this notebook computes monthly seasonal indexes for customer spending, segmented by company size, market, and industry. It outputs the average seasonal index for each calendar month across all available years by comparing each monthâ€™s spend to the yearly average. This better understanding of seasonal patterns in spending behavior allows for better forecasting, budgeting, and identifying abnormal trends in customer activity.
